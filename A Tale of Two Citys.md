#A tale of Two Ciltys 双城记
-It was a the best of times, it wass the wrost of times.  
It was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness.
It was the epoch of believe, it was the epoch of incredulity.
It was teh season of Light, it was the season of Darkness.
It was the spring of hope, it was the winter of dispair.
We had everything before every thing, we had nothing before us.
We were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct to the other way.
In short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received.
For good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.
那是最美好的时代，那是最糟糕的时代；
那是智慧的年头，那是愚昧的年头；
那是信仰的时期，那是怀疑的时期；
那是光明的季节，那是黑暗的季节；
那是希望的春天，那是失望的冬天；
我们全都在直奔天堂，我们全都在直奔相反的方向；
-简而言之，那时跟现在十分相像；某些最喧嚣的权威坚持要用形容词的最高级来形容它。
说它好，是最高级的；说他不好，也是最高级的。
It is far, far better things than I do, than I have ever done;
It is far, far better rest than I go to, than I have ever known.
我现在已做的远比我所做过的一切都美好；我将获得的休息远比我所知道的一切都甜蜜。
Never frown, even when you are sad, because you never know who is falling in love with your smile.
纵然伤心，也不要愁眉不展，因为你不知是谁会爱上你的笑容。
To the world you may be one person, but to one person you may be the world.
Don't waste your time on man/woman, who isn't willing to waste their time on you.
不要为那些不愿在你身上花费时间的人而浪费你的时间。
Just beacause someone doesn't love you the way you want them to, doesn't mean they don't love you with all they have.
爱你的人如果没有按你希望的方式爱你，那并不代表他们没有全心全意地爱你。
Don't try so hard, the best things come when you least expect them to.
不要着急，最好的总会在最不经意的时候出现。
Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong person before meating the right ones, 
so that when we finally meet the person, we will know how to be grateful.
在遇到梦中人之前，上天也许会安排我们先遇到别的人；
在我们遇见心仪的人时，便应当心存感激。
Don't cry because it is over, smile because it happened.
不要为结束而哭泣，微笑吧，为你的曾经拥有。
If you love someone, let it be and set him/her free, 
if he/she come back to you, it's meant to be.
如果你爱一个人，随遇而安，让他/她自由的飞，如果他/她还是回到你身边，那就是命中注定的。
