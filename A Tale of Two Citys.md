#A tale of Two Ciltys 双城记
-It was a the best of times, it wass the wrost of times.  
It was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness.
It was the epoch of believe, it was the epoch of incredulity.
It was teh season of Light, it was the season of Darkness.
It was the spring of hope, it was the winter of dispair.
