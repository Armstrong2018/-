#The Bigbang Theory    
Our whole uinverse was in a hot dense state;
then nearly fourteen billion years ago expansion started, wait...
the world begin to cool;
the outotrophs begins to drool;
neanderthals developed tools;
we bulit a wall (we builr the pyramids);
math, science, history, unraveling the mysteries;
"since the dawn of man" is really not that long;
as every galaxy was formed in less than it takes to sing this song;
a fraction of a second and the elements were made;
the bipeds stood up straight;
the dinasaurs all met their fate;
they tried to leap but were late.
and they all died(they froze their asses off);
the oceans and pangea;
se ya, wouldn't wanna be ya;
set in motion by the same big bang;
it's expanding ever outwrd but one day;
it will cause the stars to go the other wasy;
collapsing ever inward, we won't be here;
